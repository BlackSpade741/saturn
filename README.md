# Saturn
Welcome to Saturn, an Android app that is dedicated to make your entertainment life much easier!

## Note about this repository
The initial development of the application was done on a private repository officially linked to the course. To remove any confusion and public access to our development database, I have decided to create this new repository, with everything cleaned up. This is the reason why the initial commit was the completed app. Feel free to fork this repo and make your own changes!

## What is Saturn?
Saturn is an application that can be used to remember upcoming events and releases.

## Technologies Used
Saturn is built with Java and vanilla Android in Android Studio. The web scrapers we used 

## Business Oppurtunities
Saturn would be free to use with profit coming from partnerships. Companies could pay to show their events to more users and Saturn could implement deep links into online stores and streaming services.

Saturn has been developed by six University of Toronto students for their Introduction to Software Engineering (CSC301) class.
